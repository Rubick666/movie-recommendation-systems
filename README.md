# Movie Recommendation Systems

This repository contains implementations of two types of movie recommendation systems: Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering. The projects demonstrate how to build recommendation engines using Python and popular libraries.

## Projects Included

### 1. Collaborative Filtering (`RecommendationSystems_CollaborativeSystems.ipynb`)
- Builds a user-item collaborative filtering recommendation system.
- Uses techniques such as matrix factorization and similarity measures.
- Demonstrates recommendation generation based on user behavior.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering (`RecommenderSystems_ContentBased.ipynb`)
- Builds a content-based recommendation system using movie metadata.
- Uses feature extraction and similarity calculations to recommend movies.
- Demonstrates personalized recommendations based on item attributes.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## How to Run
1. Open the desired notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. (Optional) To run locally, install dependencies with:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Results
- Successfully generates personalized movie recommendations.
- Visualizations of similarity matrices and recommendation results included.
